Results of Operations and Financial Condition\\nOn July 21, 2005, Google is issuing a press release and holding a conference call regarding its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 ended June 30, 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.\\nThis information shall not be deemed \"filed\" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.\\nGoogle is making reference to non-GAAP financial information in both the press release and the conference call. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is contained in the attached press release.\\nItem 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits\\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\\n\\nExhibit 99.1\\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  July 21, 2005  Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2005.\\n\"We had an excellent quarter. We continued to innovate, we continued to execute and we stayed focused on our users,\" said Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive officer. \"Google had another solid performance.\"\\nGoogle reported record revenues of $1.384 billion for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, up 98% year over year. Google reports its revenues, consistent with GAAP, on a gross basis without deducting traffic acquisition costs or TAC, the portion of revenues shared with partners.\\nFinancial Highlights\\nRevenues in the second quarter totaled a record $1.384 billion, representing a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2005 and a 98% year-over-year increase. This revenue increase reflects strong traffic and monetization growth in the quarter as well as advertisers\\' growing recognition of the Internet as an effective advertising medium.\\nRevenues \\nGoogle-owned sites generated $737 million or 53% of total revenues. This represents an increase of 115% over the second quarter of 2004.\\nGoogle-Sites Revenues\\n-\\nRevenues generated on Google\\'s partner sites, through AdSense programs, contributed $630 million, or 46% of total revenues, an 82% increase over the Network revenues generated in the same quarter last year.\\nThe Google Network\\n-\\n, the portion of revenues shared with Google\\'s partners, increased to $494 million. This compares to total payments to partners of $277 million in the second quarter of 2004.\\nTAC  Traffic Acquisition Costs\\nIncome from operations in the second quarter, on a GAAP basis, was $476 million or 34.4% of revenues, and included a non-cash charge of $47 million for stock-based compensation. This compares to income from operations of $171 million or 24.4% of revenues in the second quarter of 2004, when the stock-based compensation charge was $75 million. This improvement in operating margins was primarily because of decreases in TAC, Sales and Marketing expense and stock-based compensation expense as a percentage of revenues, offset by increases in R&D, other cost of revenues and G&A expense.\\nIncome from Operations \\n Google recorded a provision for income taxes of $153 million in the second quarter of 2005, an effective tax rate of 31% as compared to a $90 million provision for income taxes and a 53% effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2004. We continue to expect that the effective tax rate for 2005 will be less than 30%. However if future revenues recognized by Google\\'s Irish subsidiary are not as proportionately significant as expected, Google\\'s effective tax rate will be higher than expected.\\nIncome Taxes\\n Net income on a GAAP basis increased to $343 million or 24.8% of revenues in the second quarter of 2005 as compared to $79 million or 11.3% of revenues in the second quarter of 2004. Earnings on a per share diluted basis were $1.19 in the second quarter of 2005 as compared to $0.30 in the second quarter of 2004.\\nNet Income\\n Net cash provided by operating activities increased 283% to $625 million for the three months ended June 30, 2005 from $163 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004. Free cash flow is an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities and is calculated as operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were approximately $158 million in the three months ended June 30, 2005 as compared to $96 million in the three months ended June 30, 2004. Free cash flow for the three months ended June 30, 2005 totaled $467 million as compared to $67 million for the same period in 2004, an increase of approximately 600%.\\nCash Flow\\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, the non-cash stock-based compensation charge and in-process R&D. It is another alternative measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA increased to approximately $590 million in the second quarter of 2005 (or 43% of revenues) from $278 million (or 40% of revenues) in the second quarter of 2004.\\nAdjusted EBITDA \\nThe reconciliations of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is set forth at the back of this release.\\n As of June 30, 2005, Google had a cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $2.9 billion.\\nCash\\nOn a worldwide basis, Google employed 4,183 full time employees as of June 30, 2005, up from 3,482 as of March 31, 2005.\\nWebcast and conference call information\\nA live audio webcast of Google\\'s second-quarter earnings release call will be available at . The call begins today at 1:30 p.m. (PDT)/ 4:30 (EDT). This press release, the financial tables as well as other supplemental information including the reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures, are also available at that site. A replay of the call will be available beginning at 7:30 PM EDT through midnight Monday, August 1, by calling (888) 203-1112 in the United States or (719) 457-0820 for calls from outside the United States. The required confirmation code for the replay is 4665218.\\nhttp://investor.google.com/news.html\\nForward looking statements\\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to Google\\'s future business prospects and our anticipated effective tax rate. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, our ability to compete with new or\\nexisting competitors, risks related to our ability to innovate and grow, risks related to our international operations, our ability to maintain and enhance our brand, and the fact that we may have exposure to greater than expected tax liabilities, as well as those risks and uncertainties included under the captions \"Factors That Could Affect Future Results\" and \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" in our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at and on the SEC\\'s website at . Additional information will also be set forth in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, which will be filed with the SEC in August 2005. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of July 21, 2005 and Google undertakes no duty to update this information.\\ninvestor.google.com\\nwww.sec.gov\\nAbout non-GAAP financial measures.\\nTo supplement Google\\'s consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Google uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Liquidity Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures\" set forth at the back of this release.\\nGoogle\\'s management believes that free cash flows and adjusted EBITDA provide meaningful supplemental information regarding liquidity. Google believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Google\\'s liquidity and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management\\'s internal comparisons to Google\\'s historical liquidity.\\nGoogle computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\\nReconciliations of non-GAAP liquidity measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures\\n1.

For purposes of this Section 6(a), Incentive Stock Options will be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares will be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.\\nISO $100,000 Rule\\n(b) .

The Performance Goals shall be set by the Administrator on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Performance Units to qualify as \"performance-based compensation\" under Section 162(m) of the Code. In granting Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or Performance Units which are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Administrator shall follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Award under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).\\nSection 162(m) Performance Restrictions\\n(iv) The foregoing limitations will be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company\\'s capitalization as described in Section 15 of the Plan.\\n(v) If an Award is cancelled in the same Fiscal Year in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 15 of the Plan), the cancelled Award will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above.

Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option will be issued in the name of the Participant or, if requested by the Participant, in the name of the Participant and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the Awarded Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company will issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 15 of the Plan or the applicable Award Agreement.\\nExercising an Option in any manner will decrease the number of Shares thereafter available for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.\\n(ii) .

If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.\\nTermination of Relationship as a Service Provider\\n(iii) . If a Participant ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Participant\\'s Disability, the Participant may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Participant\\'s termination. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if on the date of termination the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant\\'s termination. If after termination the Participant does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.\\nDisability of Participant\\n(iv) . If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Participant\\'s death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event may the option be exercised later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant\\'s designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant\\'s death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Participant, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant\\'s estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Participant\\'s will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option will remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following Participant\\'s death. Unless otherwise provided by the Administrator, if at the time of death Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option will immediately revert to the Plan on the date one (1) month following the Participant\\'s death. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option will terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option will revert to the Plan.\\nDeath of Participant\\n(e) .

After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Performance Units/Shares will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Performance Units/Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives have been achieved. After the grant of a Performance Unit/Share, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives for such Performance Unit/Share.\\nEarning of Performance Units/Shares\\n(e) . Payment of earned Performance Units/Shares will be made as soon after the expiration of the applicable Performance Period at the time determined by the Administrator. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance Units/Shares in the form of cash, in Shares (which have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Performance Units/Shares at the close of the applicable Performance Period) or in a combination thereof.\\nForm and Timing of Payment of Performance Units/Shares\\n(f) . On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, all unearned or unvested Performance Units/Shares will be forfeited to the Company, and again will be available for grant under the Plan.\\nCancellation of Performance Units/Shares\\n11. . Restricted Stock Units shall consist of a Restricted Stock, Performance Share or Performance Unit Award that the Administrator, in its sole discretion permits to be paid out in installments or on a deferred basis, in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Administrator.\\nRestricted Stock Units\\n12. . Other Stock Based Awards may be granted either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with, other Awards granted under the Plan and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan. The Administrator shall have authority to determine the Service Providers to whom and the time or times at which Other Stock Based Awards shall be made, the amount of such Other Stock Based Awards, and all other conditions of the Other Stock Based Awards including any dividend and/or voting rights.\\nOther Stock Based Awards\\n13. . Unless the Administrator provides otherwise, vesting of Awards granted hereunder will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence and will resume on the date the Participant returns to work on a regular schedule as determined by the Company; provided, however, that no vesting credit will be awarded for the time vesting has been suspended during such leave of absence. A Service Provider will not cease to be an Employee in the case of (i) any leave of absence approved by the Company or (ii) transfers between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Parent, or any Subsidiary. For purposes of Incentive Stock Options, no such leave may exceed ninety (90) days, unless reemployment upon expiration of such leave is guaranteed by statute or contract. If reemployment upon expiration of a leave of absence approved by the Company is not so guaranteed, then three months following the 91\\nLeaves of Absence\\nst\\nday of such leave any Incentive Stock Option held by the Participant will cease to be treated as an Incentive Stock Option and will be treated for tax purposes as a Nonstatutory Stock Option.\\n14. . Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Participant, only by the Participant. If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, such Award will contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.\\nNon-Transferability of Awards\\n15. .\\nAdjustments; Dissolution or Liquidation; Merger or Change in Control\\n(a) . In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares occurs such that an adjustment is determined by the Administrator (in its sole discretion) to be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Administrator shall, in such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust the number and class of Shares which may be delivered under the Plan, the 162(m) annual share issuance limits under Section 6(c) of the Plan, and the number, class, and price of Shares subject to outstanding Awards. Notwithstanding the preceding, the number of Shares subject to any Award always shall be a whole number.\\nAdjustments\\n(b) . In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for a Participant to have the right to exercise his or her Award, to the extent applicable, until ten (10) days prior to such transaction as to all of the Awarded Stock covered thereby, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. In addition, the Administrator may provide that any Company repurchase option or forfeiture rights applicable to any Award shall lapse 100%, and that any Award vesting shall accelerate 100%, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner contemplated. To the extent it has not been previously exercised or vested, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.\\nDissolution or Liquidation\\n(c) .\\nMerger or Change in Control\\n(i) . In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Option and SAR shall be assumed or an equivalent option or SAR substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. With respect to Options and SARs granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for, if immediately prior to or after the merger or Change in Control the Participant\\'s status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise such Options and SARs as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Option or SAR, the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to exercise the Option or SAR as to all of the Awarded Stock, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. If an Option or SAR is not assumed or substituted in the event of a merger or Change in Control, the Administrator shall notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the\\nStock Options and SARS\\nOption or SAR shall be exercisable, to the extent vested, for a period of up to fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Option or SAR shall terminate upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Option or SAR shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the option or stock appreciation right confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Option or SAR, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject to the Option or SAR, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant\\'s consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation\\'s post-merger or post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.\\n(ii) . In the event of a merger or Change in Control, each outstanding Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit awards shall be assumed or an equivalent Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit award substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. With respect to Awards granted to an Outside Director that are assumed or substituted for, if immediately prior to or after the merger or Change in Control the Participant\\'s status as a Director or a director of the successor corporation, as applicable, is terminated other than upon a voluntary resignation by the Participant, then the Participant shall fully vest in such Awards, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, in the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit award, the Participant shall fully vest in the Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award or Restricted Stock Unit including as to Shares which would not otherwise be vested. For the purposes of this paragraph, a Restricted Stock, Performance Share, Performance Unit, Other Stock Based Award and Restricted Stock Unit award shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or Change in Control is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received, for each Share and each unit/right to acquire a Share subject to the Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or Change in Control. Notwithstanding\\nRestricted Stock, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Restricted Stock Units and Other Stock Based Awards\\nanything herein to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such performance goals without the Participant\\'s consent; provided, however, a modification to such performance goals only to reflect the successor corporation\\'s post-merger or post-Change in Control corporate structure will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.\\n16. . The date of grant of an Award will be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination will be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.\\nDate of Grant\\n17. . Subject to Section 22 of the Plan, the Plan will become effective upon its adoption by the Board. It will continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 18 of the Plan.\\nTerm of Plan\\n18. .\\nAmendment and Termination of the Plan\\n(a) . The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.\\nAmendment and Termination\\n(b) . The Company will obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws.\\nStockholder Approval\\n(c) . Subject to Section 20 of the Plan, no amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan will impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan will not affect the Administrator\\'s ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Awards granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.\\nEffect of Amendment or Termination\\n19. .\\nConditions Upon Issuance of Shares\\n(a) . Shares will not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares will comply with Applicable Laws and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.\\nLegal Compliance\\n(b) . As a condition to the exercise or receipt of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising or receiving such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise or receipt that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.\\nInvestment Representations\\n20. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan or an Award to the contrary, if any one or more of the provisions (or any part thereof) of this Plan or the Awards shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be modified so as to make it valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions (or any part thereof) of the Plan or Award, as applicable, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.\\nSeverability\\n21. . The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company\\'s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, will relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority will not have been obtained.\\nInability to Obtain Authority\\n22. . The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted. Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.\\nStockholder Approval\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTEXT:\\nCheck the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):\\nItem 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition\\nOn April 21, 2005, Google Inc. is issuing a press release and holding a conference call regarding its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 ended March 31, 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.\\nThis information shall not be deemed \"filed\" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.\\nGoogle is making reference to non-GAAP financial information in both the press release and the conference call. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures is contained in the attached press release.\\nItem 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits\\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\\n\\nExhibit 99.1\\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  April 21, 2005  Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2005.\\n\"This was a very strong quarter for Google. We continue to execute well and we have been able to take full advantage of the growth in online advertising\" said Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive officer. \"In addition, we performed well across our operations with our engineering and product teams delivering dozens of new products and features for Google users around the world.\"\\nFinancial Highlights\\nRevenues in the quarter totaled a record $1.256 billion, representing a 22% increase over the fourth quarter of 2004 and a 93% year-over-year increase. This revenue increase reflects strong traffic and monetization growth in the quarter as well as advertisers\\' growing recognition of the Internet as an effective advertising medium.\\nRevenues -\\nGoogle-owned sites generated $657 million or 52% of total revenues. This represents an increase of 116% over the first quarter of 2004.\\nGoogle-Sites Revenues\\n-\\nRevenues generated on Google\\'s partner sites, through AdSense programs, contributed $584 million, or 47% of total revenues, a 75% increase over the Network revenues generated in the same quarter last year.\\nThe Google Network\\n-\\n, the portion of revenues shared with Google\\'s partners, increased to $462 million. This compares to total payments to partners of $271 million in the first quarter of 2004.\\nTAC  Traffic Acquisition Costs\\nIncome from operations in the first quarter, on a GAAP basis, was $443 million or 35.2% of revenues, and included a non-cash charge of $49 million for stock-based compensation. This compares to income from operations of $155 million or 23.8% of revenues in the first quarter of 2004, when the stock-based compensation charge was $76 million. This improvement in operating margins was primarily due to decreases in both stock-based compensation expense and TAC as a percentage of revenues.\\nIncome from Operations \\n- Google recorded a provision for income taxes of $87 million in the first quarter of 2005, an effective tax rate of 19% as compared to a $92 million provision for income taxes and a 59% effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2004. The provision for income taxes in this year\\'s first quarter was reduced by $49 million related to ISO disqualifying dispositions. The effective tax rate for the remainder of 2005 is expected to be less than 30%. However if future revenues recognized by Google\\'s Irish subsidiary are not as proportionately great as expected, Google\\'s effective tax rate will be higher than expected.\\nIncome Taxes\\n- Net income on a GAAP basis increased to $369 million or 29.4% of revenues in the first quarter of 2005 as compared to $64 million or 9.8% of revenues in the first quarter of 2004. Earnings on a diluted per share basis were $1.29 in the first quarter of 2005 as compared to $0.24 in the first quarter of 2004.\\nNet Income\\n Net cash provided by operating activities increased 155% to $530 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 from $208 million in the three months ended March 31, 2004. Free cash flow is an alternative non-GAAP measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities and is calculated as operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $142 million in the three months ended March 31, 2005 as compared to $86 million in the three months ended March 31, 2004. Free cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2005 totaled approximately $387 million as compared to $122 million for the same period in 2004, an increase of 217%.\\nCash Flow\\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, the non-cash stock-based compensation charge and in-process R&D. It is another alternative measure of liquidity to GAAP net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA increased to approximately $548 million in Q1 2005 (or 44% of revenues) from $255 million (or 39% of revenues) in Q1 2004.\\nAdjusted EBITDA \\nThe reconciliations of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP measure of liquidity, is set forth at the back of this release.\\n As of March 31, 2005, Google had a cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $2.507 billion.\\nCash\\nOn a worldwide basis, Google employed 3,482 full time employees as of March 31, 2005, up from 3,021 as of December 31, 2004.\\nWebcast and conference call information\\nA live audio webcast of Google\\'s first-quarter earnings release call will be available at . The call begins today at 1:30 p.m. (PDT)/ 4:30 (EDT). This press release, the financial tables as well as other supplemental information including the reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures, are also available at that site. A replay of the call will be available beginning at 7:30 PM EDT through midnight Monday, May 2, by calling (888) 203-1112 in the United States or (719) 457-0820 for calls from outside the United States. The required confirmation code for the replay is 1993546.\\nhttp://investor.google.com/news.html\\nForward looking statements\\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements relating to Google\\'s market opportunity, future business prospects and anticipated effective tax rate. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results\\nto differ from the results predicted include, among others, our ability to compete with new or existing competitors, risks related to our ability to innovate and grow, risks related to our international operations, our ability to maintain and enhance our brand, and the fact that we may have exposure to greater than expected tax liabilities, as well as those included under the captions, \"Factors That Could Affect Future Results\" and \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 which is on file with the SEC and is available on our investor relations website at and on the SEC\\'s website at . Additional information will also be set forth in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, which will be filed with the SEC in May 2005. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of April 21, 2005 and we undertake no duty to update this information.\\ninvestor.google.com\\nwww.sec.gov\\nAbout non-GAAP financial measures.\\nTo supplement Google\\'s consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Google uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the SEC: free cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, net income before certain income tax items and net income per share before certain income tax items. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the tables captioned \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Results of Operations Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures,\" and \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Liquidity Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures\" set forth at the back of this release.\\nGoogle\\'s management believes that net income and adjusted net income per share, before certain income tax items, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the company\\'s core results because they exclude amounts that are not necessarily related to those core results and are of a substantially non-recurring nature. Google\\'s management believes that free cash flows and adjusted EBITDA provide meaningful supplemental information regarding liquidity. Google believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of Google\\'s ongoing operations and liquidity and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management\\'s internal comparisons to Google\\'s historical operating results and liquidity.\\nGoogle computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. The accompanying tables have more details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Results of Operations Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures\\nThe following table presents certain non-GAAP results before certain tax items (in thousands except per share amounts, unaudited):\\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Liquidity Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures\\n1.

Nevertheless, as we swoop over Florida's Tampa Bay on a gorgeous November morning, I enthusiastically take over the controls of the ICON A5, a two-seater amphibious plane that looks like a sports car, maneuvers like a jet ski and is so intuitive, the company says that even a novice can learn to fly it in less than 30 hours.At 23 feet long and weighing in a 1,510 pounds, it's known as a sea light-sport aircraft.Designed to help you focus on the freedom of flying without worrying if the plane will react unpredictably, there's nothing else quite like it on the market.Read MoreNow that I'm in control, my whole body tenses for a good five minutes. Am I really ready to pilot this shiny new machine all by myself? I'm not entirely sure.However, I take comfort in the fact that the A5 was built specifically for people like me, and it was designed to drive like a car. Plus, the fact that Icon's CEO and founder, Kirk Hawkins, is next to me in the cockpit doesn't hurt either. He can take over the controls at any time.So far, so good.We glide smoothly through the air at about 1,000 feet, and I'm comfortable enough to take in the sights.
